        <h1>Understanding the Different Categories of Traffic Signs in Spain</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Traffic signs play a crucial role in maintaining order and safety on the roads of Spain. Whether you are a local driver or a tourist exploring the country, understanding the various categories of traffic signs is essential for navigating Spanish roads confidently and legally. In this article, we will explore the three main categories of traffic signs in Spain: regulatory, warning, and informational signs.</p>

        <h2>1. Regulatory Signs (Señales de Regulación)</h2>
        <p>Regulatory signs are mandatory and enforce the rules of the road. Ignoring these signs can lead to penalties, fines, or even accidents. They are typically circular in shape with red, white, and black colors, although some may vary depending on their purpose. Below are the subcategories of regulatory signs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prohibitory Signs:</strong> These indicate actions that are not allowed, such as "No Entry" (Señal de Prohibición de Entrada) or speed limits. They usually feature a red circle with a symbol inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandatory Signs:</strong> These inform drivers of actions they must take, such as "Turn Right" or "Proceed Straight Ahead." These signs are blue with white symbols.</li>
            <li><strong>Priority Signs:</strong> These establish the right of way and include signs like "Yield" (Ceda el Paso) or "Stop" (Señal de Stop). Priority signs are crucial at intersections to avoid confusion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Warning Signs (Señales de Advertencia)</h2>
        <p>Warning signs alert drivers to potential hazards or changes in road conditions ahead. They are triangular in shape with a red border and a white background containing a black symbol. These signs help drivers prepare for specific situations, ensuring they can adjust their speed or driving behavior accordingly.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sharp Turns:</strong> Indicates a sharp curve or series of curves ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Pedestrian Crossings:</strong> Warns of areas where pedestrians frequently cross the road.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal Crossings:</strong> Alerts drivers to areas where animals may be present on or near the road.</li>
            <li><strong>Steep Slopes:</strong> Indicates steep inclines or declines, which require extra caution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Informational Signs (Señales de Información)</h2>
        <p>Informational signs provide helpful guidance and directions to drivers. These signs are typically rectangular and use a variety of colors depending on their purpose. They are designed to make traveling more convenient by providing relevant information about routes, facilities, or destinations.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direction and Distance:</strong> Indicate the distance to cities, towns, or landmarks.</li>
            <li><strong>Road Identification:</strong> Mark highways and major roads, such as the "A-7" for Autopista del Mediterráneo.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Signs:</strong> Inform drivers about nearby facilities, such as gas stations, rest areas, or hospitals.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourist Attractions:</strong> Highlight points of interest like historical sites or natural parks.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Tips for Recognizing Spanish Traffic Signs</h3>
            <p>While the design of traffic signs in Spain largely adheres to European standards, some specific features are worth noting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> Many signs feature Spanish text, though symbols are universally recognizable.</li>
                <li><strong>Colors and Shapes:</strong> Pay attention to the shape and color of the signs, as these often indicate their category and importance.</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary Signs:</strong> Be cautious of temporary signs, especially in construction zones. These are usually yellow and indicate temporary rules or hazards.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
